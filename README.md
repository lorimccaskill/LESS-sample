An example of using LESS (CSS pre-processor) to create a “Workspace Access Point” menu, part of a larger web application developed at S&P Capital IQ. I developed the menu based on design specs provided by other team members.

When combined, library.less and wsMenu.less create CSS output recorded in prototype.css. (The online resource [less2css.org](http://less2css.org/) demonstrates how LESS input translates to CSS output used by the browser.)
